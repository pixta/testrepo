##Block quote
>In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream 
At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines 
Sprung from cages out on highway 9, 
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin' out over the line 
h-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back 
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap 
We gotta get out while we're young 
`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run  
- Bruce Sprinsteen
